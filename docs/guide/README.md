Pressure is very important to me. Good pressure, such as having a lot of assignments to work on, or approaching deadline, helps me to stay motivated and positive. Talk to my manager and give feedback to my team members as soon as possible. For example, I once had three large projects due in the same week, which was a lot of pressure.
